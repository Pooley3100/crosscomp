[✔️] = questions on the side
[✔️] = click on questions selects the crossword
[✔️] = can use ... to better set letterObj for sure
[✔️] = update letterGrid array immutably
[✔️] = send each word to api
[✔️] = refactor states a bit, maybe lift up a bit TOO MANY STATES
[] = making too many api requests for opponent
[] = change {key} variable name in questions and lettergrid - too confusing
[] = maybe attach question reference to each individual cell in lettergrid instead of calculation each time?
[] = api with communication query for all crossword if answer is correct
[] = communication between two accounts on same crossword
[] = user accounts creation.
[] = unit tests.
[] = variable size crossword uhoh, 5 is used like everywhere
[] = maybe use a llm to create crosswords (some sort of backend engine creating them, even just with a dictionary and match???
[] = better movement to next cell on completion (like if next is done already)

MAIN OBJS
[] = two users simultaneously play (I think just server polling atm)
[] = user log in with hist and accountID
[] = change crosswords and create new ones

BUGS:
[] = Slight overlap when resizing screen.
