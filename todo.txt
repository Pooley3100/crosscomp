[✔️] = update letterGrid array immutably
[✔️] = send each word to api
[✔️] = refactor states a bit, maybe lift up a bit TOO MANY STATES

[] = maybe attach question reference to each individual cell in lettergrid instead of calculation each time?
[] = api with communication query for all crossword if answer is correct
[] = communication between two accounts on same crossword
[] = user accounts.
[] = unit tests.
[] = variable size crossword uhoh, 5 is used like everywhere
